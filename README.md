What part was hardest and why? 
The hardest part was using transactions and triggers to manage data consistency across several tables.  It took a lot of preparation and testing to make sure that loan statuses and book availability updated accurately.
Which concept helped them think like a backend dev? 
One important step in adopting a backend developer mindset was putting user-defined functions and stored procedures into practice.  These reusable, modular parts enhanced data control and logic organization.
How would they test this if it were a live web app? 
I would simulate real-world procedures, such as checking for edge cases like past-due loans or invalid entries, making payments, and borrowing and returning books, if the system were put into use.  After every operation, I would also confirm database integrity using front-end forms and APIs.
